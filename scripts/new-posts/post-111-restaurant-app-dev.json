For a restaurant operating on 5-10% margins, that's the difference between profit and loss. A <strong>branded mobile app</strong> lets you own the customer relationship, eliminate commissions, and build a direct channel for orders, loyalty, and marketing.</p>\n<p>The data backs this up. Restaurants with branded apps see <strong>20-30% higher order frequency</strong> from app users compared to walk-in-only customers, according to <a href='https://www.touchbistro.com' rel='noopener'>TouchBistro's 2025 industry report</a>. Push notifications alone drive a 7-10% response rate — far higher than email (2%) or social media (0.5%).</p>\n<p>But building the wrong app can be just as costly as not having one. This guide covers exactly what your restaurant app needs, what it will cost, and how to choose the right approach.</p>\n\n<h2>Essential Features Every Restaurant App Needs</h2>\n<p>Not every restaurant needs every feature. But these are the core capabilities that drive ROI:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Online Ordering (Pickup & Delivery)</h3>\n<p>This is the revenue engine. Your app must support browsing a visual menu, customizing orders (add/remove toppings, special instructions), selecting pickup or delivery, and paying securely. GPS-based delivery tracking is now expected, not optional.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Loyalty & Rewards Program</h3>\n<p>Digital loyalty programs replace paper punch cards and give you data on every visit. The best implementations use a <strong>points-per-dollar</strong> model that encourages higher spending. A customer earning 1 point per $1 with a $10 reward at 100 points will spend 15-25% more per visit to hit milestones faster. Learn more in our <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/restaurant-loyalty-program-apps'>complete guide to restaurant loyalty apps</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Push Notifications</h3>\n<p>Push notifications are the highest-engagement marketing channel available. Use them for flash deals (\"50% off appetizers until 3pm\"), order status updates, and loyalty milestone reminders. But don't overuse them — more than 3 per week leads to uninstalls.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Menu Management</h3>\n<p>You need to update your menu in real-time without waiting for a developer. 86'd an item? It should disappear from the app instantly. Running a seasonal special? You should be able to add it from your phone. Look for a CMS-powered menu system.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Reservation & Waitlist</h3>\n<p>For dine-in restaurants, an integrated reservation system eliminates the need for separate tools like Resy or OpenTable (which also charge commissions and own your customer data).</p>\n\n<h3>6. Payment Processing</h3>\n<p>Support Apple Pay, Google Pay, credit cards, and stored payment methods. Friction at checkout kills conversions. One-tap reordering (saving the customer's favorite orders) can increase repeat order rates by 40%.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Analytics Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Track daily revenue, popular items, peak ordering times, customer retention rates, and lifetime value. This data drives menu engineering and marketing decisions. Pair this with the right <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/restaurant-marketing-tools'>restaurant marketing tools</a> for maximum impact.</p>\n\n<h2>Build vs Buy: Custom App vs Off-the-Shelf</h2>\n<p>This is the most important decision you'll make. Here's an honest comparison:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Factor</th><th>Custom App</th><th>Off-the-Shelf (Toast, ChowNow, etc.)</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Upfront Cost</td><td>$15,000 – $100,000+</td><td>$0 – $500/month</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly Cost</td><td>$200 – $1,000 (hosting/maintenance)</td><td>$100 – $500/month + potential commissions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Branding</td><td>100% your brand, your App Store listing</td><td>Their platform, your logo on it</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Features</td><td>Anything you want</td><td>Limited to their feature set</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Data Ownership</td><td>You own everything</td><td>Shared or restricted access</td></tr>\n<tr><td>POS Integration</td><td>Custom integration needed</td><td>Usually built-in</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Time to Launch</td><td>3-6 months</td><td>1-4 weeks</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Best For</td><td>Multi-location, unique workflows</td><td>Single location, quick launch</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>The honest answer:</strong> If you're a single-location restaurant that just needs ordering and loyalty, an off-the-shelf solution like the ones in our <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/best-online-ordering-system-for-restaurants'>online ordering systems comparison</a> may be sufficient. If you have 3+ locations, unique workflows, or want to own your brand and data completely, custom is the way to go.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Breakdown: What Restaurant App Development Actually Costs</h2>\n\n<h3>Tier 1: Basic Ordering App</h3>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $15,000 – $30,000 | <strong>Timeline:</strong> 8-12 weeks</p>\n<p>Menu browsing, cart, checkout, order confirmation. Single platform (iOS or Android). Basic admin panel. No loyalty, no push notifications, no delivery tracking.</p>\n\n<h3>Tier 2: Full-Featured Restaurant App</h3>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $30,000 – $75,000 | <strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-5 months</p>\n<p>Everything in Tier 1, plus: loyalty program, push notifications, delivery tracking, reservation system, analytics dashboard, CMS-powered menu, both iOS and Android.</p>\n\n<h3>Tier 3: Enterprise / Multi-Location</h3>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $75,000 – $200,000+ | <strong>Timeline:</strong> 5-9 months</p>\n<p>Everything in Tier 2, plus: multi-location management, centralized analytics, kitchen display system integration, advanced POS integration, white-label capability, AI-powered recommendations.</p>\n\n<h2>Development Timeline: From Concept to App Store</h2>\n<p>Here's a realistic week-by-week breakdown for a Tier 2 restaurant app:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Duration</th><th>Deliverables</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Discovery & Planning</td><td>Weeks 1-2</td><td>Requirements doc, wireframes, tech stack decision</td></tr>\n<tr><td>UI/UX Design</td><td>Weeks 3-4</td><td>Full visual design, interactive prototype</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Backend Development</td><td>Weeks 5-8</td><td>APIs, database, admin panel, payment integration</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Frontend Development</td><td>Weeks 6-10</td><td>iOS and Android apps built in parallel</td></tr>\n<tr><td>QA Testing</td><td>Weeks 10-12</td><td>Bug fixes, device testing, load testing</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Soft Launch</td><td>Week 13</td><td>Beta release to staff and select customers</td></tr>\n<tr><td>App Store Submission</td><td>Weeks 14-15</td><td>App Store and Google Play approval</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Public Launch</td><td>Week 16</td><td>Marketing push, in-store promotion</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Technology Stack: What Your App Should Be Built With</h2>\n<p>The technology stack affects your app's performance, cost, and long-term maintainability. Here's what we recommend for restaurant apps in 2026:</p>\n\n<h3>Cross-Platform (Recommended for Most Restaurants)</h3>\n<p><strong>React Native</strong> or <strong>Flutter</strong> let you build one codebase that runs on both iOS and Android, saving 30-40% in development costs. React Native has a larger ecosystem and is used by Meta, Shopify, and Discord. Flutter offers faster UI rendering and is backed by Google. For a detailed comparison, see our <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/startup-tech-stack'>startup tech stack guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Backend</h3>\n<p><strong>Node.js + Firebase</strong> or <strong>Node.js + PostgreSQL</strong> are the most common choices. Firebase offers real-time database, authentication, and push notifications out of the box, making it ideal for restaurant apps that need instant order updates.</p>\n\n<h3>Payment Processing</h3>\n<p><strong>Stripe</strong> is the industry standard. It handles credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and supports international payments. For restaurants, Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction is significantly cheaper than DoorDash's 15-30% commission.</p>\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n\n<h3>How much does it cost to build a restaurant app?</h3>\n<p>A basic ordering app costs $15,000–$30,000. A full-featured app with loyalty, push notifications, and delivery tracking costs $30,000–$75,000. Enterprise multi-location apps cost $75,000–$200,000+. Off-the-shelf alternatives like Toast or ChowNow cost $100–$500/month with potential commission fees.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I need a custom app or can I use an off-the-shelf solution?</h3>\n<p>If you have 1-2 locations and standard needs, an off-the-shelf solution is probably sufficient. If you have 3+ locations, unique workflows, or want complete ownership of your brand and customer data, invest in a custom app.</p>\n\n<h3>How long does it take to develop a restaurant app?</h3>\n<p>A basic app takes 8-12 weeks. A full-featured app takes 3-5 months. Enterprise apps take 5-9 months. These timelines assume clear requirements — vague scope will extend any project.</p>\n\n<h3>Should I build for iOS, Android, or both?</h3>\n<p>Both. In the US, iOS holds about 55% market share and Android 45%. Using a cross-platform framework like React Native lets you build for both from a single codebase at roughly 60-70% of the cost of two native apps.</p>\n\n<h2>Ready to Build Your Restaurant App?</h2>\n<p><a href='https://usebuildify.com/contact'>Talk to Buildify</a> about building a branded restaurant app that eliminates commissions, owns your customer data, and drives repeat business.
