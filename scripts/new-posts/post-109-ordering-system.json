    "content": "\n<h2>The Commission Trap That's Killing Restaurant Margins</h2>\n<p>DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub collectively processed over <strong>$60 billion in delivery orders</strong> in 2025. They also took 15-30% of every single transaction. For a restaurant operating on 5-10% profit margins, that math is devastating: a $50 order on DoorDash nets you $35-42.50, while the delivery app keeps $7.50-15.00 — often more than your actual profit on that order.</p>\n<p>But here's what most restaurant owners don't realize: <strong>you're not just losing money, you're losing customers.</strong> When someone orders through DoorDash, DoorDash owns that customer relationship. They have the email, the phone number, the order history. You have nothing. You can't retarget them, you can't send them a birthday offer, you can't even email them about a new menu item. You're renting customers instead of owning them.</p>\n<p>A direct online ordering system changes this equation completely. You take orders through your own website or branded app, pay zero commissions, and own every piece of customer data. This guide compares the 7 best options available in 2026 so you can make the right choice.</p>\n\n<h2>What to Look For in a Restaurant Ordering System</h2>\n<p>Before diving into individual platforms, understand the features that separate great ordering systems from expensive mistakes:</p>\n\n<h3>Commission Structure</h3>\n<p>This is the #1 factor. Some platforms charge per-order commissions (just like DoorDash), some charge flat monthly fees, and some charge nothing. <strong>Always calculate your annual cost</strong> based on your actual order volume, not just the monthly price.</p>\n\n<h3>Mobile Optimization</h3>\n<p>Over <strong>72% of online food orders</strong> are placed on mobile devices (Statista, 2026). If the ordering experience isn't fast and friction-free on a phone, you'll lose customers at checkout. Look for one-tap reordering, Apple Pay/Google Pay support, and responsive design.</p>\n\n<h3>Built-in Loyalty & Marketing</h3>\n<p>The best ordering systems don't just process transactions — they drive repeat business. Look for integrated <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/restaurant-loyalty-program-apps'>loyalty programs</a>, automated SMS marketing, and push notifications. These features are what turn a one-time orderer into a regular. See our <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/restaurant-marketing-tools'>restaurant marketing tools guide</a> for a deeper dive.</p>\n\n<h3>Customer Data Ownership</h3>\n<p>You must own your customers' emails, phone numbers, and order history. This is non-negotiable. If the platform restricts access to your own customer data, walk away.</p>\n\n<h3>POS Integration</h3>\n<p>Online orders should flow directly into your existing POS system (Square, Toast, Clover, etc.) without manual re-entry. Dual-entry leads to errors, slower fulfillment, and frustrated staff.</p>\n\n<h2>The 7 Best Online Ordering Systems Compared</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Monthly Cost</th><th>Commission</th><th>Best For</th><th>Loyalty Built-in</th><th>Branded App</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Buildify Business</strong></td><td>$650/mo</td><td>0%</td><td>Full ownership, custom branded app</td><td>Yes (included)</td><td>Yes (iOS + Android)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ChowNow</td><td>$149-399/mo</td><td>0%</td><td>Commission-free simplicity</td><td>Add-on</td><td>Yes (their template)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Toast Online Ordering</td><td>$0-75/mo (with Toast POS)</td><td>0% (but requires Toast POS)</td><td>Toast POS users</td><td>Add-on ($50-75/mo)</td><td>No</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Square Online</td><td>$0-72/mo</td><td>2.9% + $0.30 processing</td><td>Square POS users, budget-conscious</td><td>Add-on ($45-90/mo)</td><td>No</td></tr>\n<tr><td>MenuDrive</td><td>$149-299/mo</td><td>0%</td><td>Independent restaurants</td><td>Basic</td><td>No</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GloriaFood (Oracle)</td><td>$0 (free), $29/mo premium</td><td>0%</td><td>Zero-budget restaurants</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Olo</td><td>Custom (enterprise)</td><td>Per-order fee</td><td>Multi-location chains (50+)</td><td>Via integrations</td><td>Custom</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Detailed Reviews</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Buildify Business — Best Overall for Ownership & Growth</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'>$650/month</a> | <strong>Commission:</strong> 0%, ever | <strong>Upfront cost:</strong> $0</p>\n<p>Buildify isn't just an ordering system — it's a complete business growth platform. You get a fully custom-branded native app (iOS + Android) published under your restaurant's name in the App Store. Online ordering, loyalty program, push notifications, AI insights dashboard, event calendar, and live user analytics are all included in the monthly price. No add-ons, no hidden fees, no commissions.</p>\n<p>The key differentiator is <strong>ownership</strong>. Your app. Your brand. Your data. Your App Store listing. Customers download <em>your</em> app, not a third-party platform with your logo on it. This builds the kind of brand equity that actually compounds over time.</p>\n<p><strong>What's included at $650/mo:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom-branded native mobile app (iOS + Android)</li>\n<li>Commission-free online ordering</li>\n<li>Digital loyalty & rewards program</li>\n<li>Unlimited push notifications</li>\n<li>AI insights dashboard</li>\n<li>Live user analytics</li>\n<li>Event calendar</li>\n<li>Ongoing support & maintenance (included, not $150/hr)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compare that to building custom:</strong> Traditional app development costs $50,000–$200,000 upfront plus $1,000-3,000/month in maintenance. Buildify gives you the same result for $650/month with $0 upfront.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Restaurants that want complete ownership of their brand, data, and customer experience without the massive upfront investment of custom development.</p>\n<p>→ <a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'><strong>See the full Buildify Business offering →</strong></a></p>\n\n<h3>2. ChowNow — Best Commission-Free Alternative</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $149-$399/month | <strong>Commission:</strong> 0%</p>\n<p>ChowNow was one of the first platforms to offer commission-free ordering for restaurants. They provide a branded ordering website and a listing in ChowNow's consumer marketplace. The mobile app is technically \"branded\" but it's a templated ChowNow app with your logo — not a standalone App Store listing under your name.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> True commission-free model, good POS integrations (Square, Toast, Clover), dedicated onboarding support.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The \"branded app\" is a ChowNow template (not truly custom), loyalty is an add-on, limited marketing automation, higher tier pricing approaches agency costs. No AI analytics or insights.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Toast Online Ordering — Best for Toast POS Users</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $0-$75/month (requires Toast POS) | <strong>Commission:</strong> 0%</p>\n<p>If you already use Toast for your POS, adding Toast Online Ordering is the path of least resistance. Orders flow directly into your Toast POS with zero integration work. The free plan covers basic ordering; the paid plan adds commission-free delivery management.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Seamless Toast POS integration, solid reporting, no commission. Toast's entire ecosystem (POS, ordering, loyalty, payments) works as one system.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Only works with Toast POS (vendor lock-in), loyalty is a separate $50-75/month add-on, no standalone mobile app, Toast's own delivery takes a fee.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Square Online — Best Budget Option</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free - $72/month | <strong>Processing:</strong> 2.9% + $0.30</p>\n<p>Square Online has a genuinely free plan that lets you accept online orders with no monthly fee — you only pay payment processing (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction). For a restaurant doing $10,000/month in online orders, that's $290 + $0.30×orders in processing. It's not truly \"commission-free\" but it's dramatically cheaper than DoorDash.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Free to start, excellent Square POS integration, clean interface, good for small restaurants testing online ordering. Strong brand recognition builds customer trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Processing fees add up at high volume, loyalty is a separate $45-90/month add-on, no branded mobile app, limited customization, you're building on Square's platform (not your brand).</p>\n\n<h3>5. MenuDrive — Solid Mid-Range Option</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $149-$299/month | <strong>Commission:</strong> 0%</p>\n<p>MenuDrive offers a straightforward commission-free ordering website with decent customization. Their stronger suit is email marketing integration and a basic loyalty program included in higher tiers.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> No commissions, solid email marketing tools, good for restaurants that want a simple web-based ordering solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> No mobile app, dated interface compared to newer competitors, limited POS integrations, smaller company with less support resources.</p>\n\n<h3>6. GloriaFood (Oracle) — Best Free Option</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free core | <strong>Commission:</strong> 0%</p>\n<p>GloriaFood is genuinely free for basic online ordering — no monthly fee, no commissions. The catch is that the free version is limited: no loyalty, no marketing tools, basic design. Premium features cost $29/month, which is still extremely affordable. Oracle acquired GloriaFood in 2020, so there's enterprise backing.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Actually free, surprisingly functional for the price, good for small restaurants with zero budget for tech.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Very basic design that feels dated, no branded app, limited analytics, free tier has GloriaFood branding on your ordering page, minimal support.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Olo — Enterprise Only</h3>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Custom (enterprise pricing) | <strong>Fees:</strong> Per-order processing fee</p>\n<p>Olo powers digital ordering for Shake Shack, Wingstop, Denny's, and Five Guys. It's an enterprise platform designed for chains with 50+ locations. Olo integrates with virtually every POS, delivery service, and loyalty platform on the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Proven at massive scale, deepest integrations in the industry, handles complex multi-location operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Not accessible to independent restaurants, per-order fees eat into margins at scale, complex implementation requiring dedicated technical resources, 6-12 month setup timeline.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Comparison: Real Numbers for a Real Restaurant</h2>\n<p>Let's compare annual costs for a restaurant doing <strong>$25,000/month in online orders</strong> (~$300K/year):</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Monthly Cost</th><th>Annual Cost</th><th>You Keep</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>DoorDash (25% commission)</td><td>$6,250/mo in fees</td><td>$75,000/yr</td><td>$225,000</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Uber Eats (15% commission)</td><td>$3,750/mo in fees</td><td>$45,000/yr</td><td>$255,000</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Square Online (2.9% + $0.30)</td><td>~$825/mo</td><td>~$9,900/yr</td><td>$290,100</td></tr>\n<tr><td>ChowNow ($249/mo plan)</td><td>$249/mo</td><td>$2,988/yr</td><td>$297,012</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Toast Online ($75/mo)</td><td>$75/mo*</td><td>$900/yr*</td><td>$299,100</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Buildify Business</strong></td><td><strong>$650/mo</strong></td><td><strong>$7,800/yr</strong></td><td><strong>$292,200</strong></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>*Toast requires their POS hardware ($0-$799 upfront) and payment processing (2.49-2.99% + $0.15). Toast loyalty adds $50-75/mo. Actual annual cost with all features is significantly higher.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Switching from DoorDash to a direct ordering system saves you $37,000-$67,000 per year in commissions alone. That's not a marginal improvement — it's a transformational shift in profitability. And unlike platforms that charge less but give you a generic template, <a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'>Buildify Business</a> gives you a fully custom-branded app with loyalty, push notifications, and AI analytics included — all for $650/month with zero upfront cost.</p>\n\n<h2>The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About</h2>\n<p>When comparing platforms, most restaurant owners only look at the monthly fee. Here's what they miss:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Loyalty Program Add-Ons</h3>\n<p>Toast charges $50-75/month extra for loyalty. Square charges $45-90/month. ChowNow's loyalty is a premium add-on. Over a year, these \"add-ons\" cost $540-$1,080 on top of the base price. Buildify includes loyalty at no extra cost.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Push Notification Fees</h3>\n<p>Most web-only ordering platforms don't offer push notifications at all (because you need a mobile app for that). Push notifications have a <strong>7-10% engagement rate</strong> vs email's 2%. Without a branded app, you're missing the highest-ROI marketing channel available.</p>\n\n<h3>3. No Customer Data (The Invisible Cost)</h3>\n<p>When you use a third-party platform, you're giving away your most valuable asset: customer data. You can't build an email list, you can't create lookalike audiences for ads, and you can't do personalized marketing. The lifetime value difference between a restaurant with customer data and one without is enormous.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Brand Dilution</h3>\n<p>When customers order through DoorDash or use \"ChowNow-branded\" ordering, they associate the experience with that platform, not your restaurant. A <a href='https://usebuildify.com/post/mobile-app-development-for-restaurants'>custom-branded app</a> builds brand equity with every single order.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Switch from Third-Party Delivery Apps</h2>\n<p>You don't have to go cold turkey. Here's the smart migration strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Set up your direct ordering system. Get it live and tested.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Promote direct ordering in-store: table tents, receipt messaging, staff mentions. Offer a 10% discount for first-time direct orders.</li>\n<li><strong>Month 2-3:</strong> Launch your loyalty program. Give bonus points for direct orders. Build your customer database.</li>\n<li><strong>Month 3-6:</strong> Gradually increase DoorDash/Uber Eats menu prices by 10-15% (to offset their commission), making your direct ordering channel the better deal for customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Month 6+:</strong> Evaluate. Most restaurants find that 40-60% of their delivery orders shift to direct ordering within 6 months, saving tens of thousands annually.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n\n<h3>What is the best online ordering system for restaurants in 2026?</h3>\n<p>For complete brand ownership and the most features included, <a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'>Buildify Business</a> at $650/month offers the best value — you get a custom-branded app, loyalty program, push notifications, AI analytics, and $0 upfront cost. For budget-conscious restaurants, Square Online's free plan or GloriaFood's free tier are good starting points, though they lack mobile apps and marketing tools.</p>\n\n<h3>How much do restaurants pay in commission to DoorDash?</h3>\n<p>DoorDash charges restaurants 15-30% commission per order depending on the service tier. On a $50 order, that's $7.50-$15.00 in fees. For a restaurant doing $25,000/month in delivery, that's $3,750-$7,500/month — or $45,000-$90,000 per year — going directly to DoorDash instead of your business.</p>\n\n<h3>Can I have my own restaurant ordering app without spending $50,000?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Traditional custom app development costs $50,000-$200,000 upfront, but platforms like <a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'>Buildify Business</a> provide a fully custom-branded native app for $650/month with $0 upfront. You get the same result — your app, your brand, published in the App Store — without the massive initial investment.</p>\n\n<h3>What's the difference between commission-free and truly free ordering platforms?</h3>\n<p>Commission-free means no per-order percentage fee, but there's usually a monthly subscription ($75-$650/month). Truly free platforms like GloriaFood's basic tier charge nothing but are severely limited in features and customization. You generally get what you pay for.</p>\n\n<h3>Should I keep DoorDash if I have my own ordering system?</h3>\n<p>Yes, at least initially. Use DoorDash for discovery — new customers find you there. But incentivize repeat orders through your direct channel by offering lower prices, exclusive deals, and loyalty rewards. The goal is to acquire on DoorDash and retain on your own platform.</p>\n\n<h2>Stop Giving Away Your Profits</h2>\n<p>Every month you stay on third-party delivery apps without a direct ordering channel, you're losing $3,000-$7,000+ in pure profit. That's money that could fund renovations, hire staff, or open a second location.</p>\n<p><a href='https://usebuildify.com/business'><strong>→ See what Buildify Business includes for $650/month</strong></a> — custom-branded app, commission-free ordering, loyalty program, push notifications, AI insights, and support included. $0 upfront.
